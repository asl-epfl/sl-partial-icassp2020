Figs. 1 and 2 are generated executing file 'codefig12.py'.

Fig. 3 is generated executing file 'codefig3.py'.

Fig. 4 is generated executing file 'codefig4.py'.

Fig. 5 is generated executing file 'codefig5.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
